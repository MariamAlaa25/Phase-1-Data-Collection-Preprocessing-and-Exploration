Project Overview
------------------------------------------------------------
This notebook, Data_Exploration_phase1, provides an in-depth exploration of Twitter engagement data. The analysis includes examining correlations between various Twitter metrics (e.g., likes, retweets, replies) to identify relationships that can inform future modeling efforts. This exploration is part of the initial phase in building a predictive model for Twitter engagement.

Dataset Description
-------------------------------------------------------------
The dataset used in this notebook contains various Twitter metrics, user information, and location data. Below is a description of the key columns:

1-Tweet Metrics
--------------------------------------------------------------
tweet_id: Unique identifier for each tweet.
tweet_text: The content of the tweet.
created_at: Timestamp of when the tweet was created.
lang: Language of the tweet.
retweet_count: Number of times the tweet has been retweeted.
reply_count: Number of replies to the tweet.
like_count: Number of likes the tweet has received.
quote_count: Number of times the tweet has been quoted.
impression_count: Number of times the tweet was displayed to users.

2-User Information
--------------------------------------------------------------
user_id: Unique identifier for each user.
user_name: The user's Twitter handle.
user_name_informal: Informal version of the user's name, if available.
user_location: The location specified in the user's profile.
profile_image_url: URL of the user's profile image.
followers_count: Number of followers the user has.
following_count: Number of accounts the user is following.
tweet_count: Total number of tweets posted by the user.
listed_count: Number of times the user has been added to Twitter lists.

3-Location Information
--------------------------------------------------------------
place_id: Unique identifier for the location.
country: Country where the tweet originated.
country_code: Numeric country code.
name: Name of the place.
full_name: Full name of the location.
place_type: Type of place (e.g., city, neighborhood).
geo_bbox_0, geo_bbox_1, geo_bbox_2, geo_bbox_3: Geographic bounding box coordinates of the place.

1-Data Loading:

Loads and prepares the dataset for analysis, handling any preliminary cleaning and transformation.

2-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Descriptive Statistics: Summary of key metrics to understand the distribution and central tendencies.
Correlation Analysis: A heatmap visualizes the relationships between metrics like likes, retweets, followers, etc., highlighting which features may be most predictive of engagement.
Feature Insights: Analysis of which metrics are most interrelated and which ones have minimal impact on engagement.

3-Considerations for Model Selection:

Based on correlation and feature relevance, we outline initial considerations for future model selection, including potential feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, and model complexity.

Key Findings
---------------------------------------------------------------
Strong Correlations: Metrics like likes, retweets, and replies are strongly correlated, suggesting these should be prioritized in models focused on engagement.

Weak Correlations: Following count and impression count have low correlation with other engagement metrics, indicating they may add limited predictive value.

Feature Selection Guidance: Insights from correlation analysis will help in choosing relevant features and potentially simplifying models by removing weakly correlated metrics
